# Introduction

The following Guides are short examples of how to use RISE tooling to do common
tasks with the RISE blockchain. These guides are developer focused and require
a basic understanding of JavaScript. To follow along you will need to install
the latest version of Node.js and NPM, which you can [download
here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Alternatively you can use a tool
like [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) if you want to have
multiple versions of Node.js installed.

All of the examples provided also have typings for TypeScript, however for
simplicity sake (and to be able to follow along in the node console) we will
use vanilla JavaScript. Get started by [link href="pages/quick-start/CreateAnAccount"]Creating an Account[/link]!
